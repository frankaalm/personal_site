I worked in a group with 3 other students to create the game minesweeper.<br> We used FLTK to generate the graphics and the code was written in C++.<br>Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the user has to uncover all the numbers without detonating any of the mines. The game relies on user inputs and randomization.<br>
